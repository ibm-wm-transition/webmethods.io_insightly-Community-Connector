## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
This connector requires any [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/) version between 8.14.0 and 10.14.0

Note: If you have installed any other Node version on your system, you can:
1. Use tools to switch between different versions of Node

  - For Windows, use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades).
  
  - For Mac, use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Build your app using your existing Node version and then transpile your code using a transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

The connector has been built with [wmiocli](https://docs.webmethods.io/integration/developer_guide/connector_builder/#gsc.tab=0), webmethod.io's iPaaS Connector Builder CLI tool, which must be installed.
